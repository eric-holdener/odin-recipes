# odin-recipes
This is the first mini project in "The Odin Projects" foundations course, covering basic HTML usage. 

The skills used in this project should be: basic HTML boilerplate, elements and tags, working with text, lists, and links and images.

Reflection:
This project was relatively easy for me. The main thing that caused this project to take a bit for me to get through was just typing all the information out, since all the text on the page had to be sourced and then either retyped or copy pasted, depending on what was quickest in the workflow. I did learn alot about the workflow of committing and pushing to github after every individual file change, as well as properly denoting what I was doing and just using VCS overall. I also picked up on some general workflows and hotkeys on my keyboard to make the whole process of making these webpages quicker for myself. I'm definitely ready to move onto the next part of the Odin Project.
