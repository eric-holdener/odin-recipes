    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350° F. Spray 9 x 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook beef with taco seasoning mix, according to seasoning package instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
            To prepare 1 burrito: spread 1/4 cup beans down center of tortillas; 
            top with 1/2 cup rice, beef, 2 tablespoons corn, and 1/4 cup cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold in opposite sides of each tortilla, then roll up, burrito style. 
            Place, seam-sides down, in prepared dish. Repeat with remaining ingredients to prepare 6 total burritos.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes (until heated through). 
            If you are baking the burritos from the refrigerator while they’re still cold, 
            it will take about 30-35 minutes for them to heat through.
